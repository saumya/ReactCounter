React Counter
================
A [React][1] application to count the days for any purpose.           
Technologies used
 - [React][1]
 - [Flux][2]
 - [Babel][3]

CSS library
 - [Skeleton][4]
 - [Pure][5]

To compile and pack the project, here are the commands
 - npm run 2js
 - npm run pack

### keyMirror lib is not needed
 - check the CountStore.js for the example         
 
I have commented out the 'keyMirror', but the application still works fine
